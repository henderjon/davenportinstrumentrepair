			<h1> Welcome to Davenport Instrument Repair</h1>
			<p>	We have been servicing the Twin Cities, MN for over 30 years and remain one of the most established and busiest
				repair companies in the metro area. We have a rich history in repair of instruments for 16
				school districts, professional jazz pop, and rock artist, local university, college, and conservatory
				teachers, their students and local musicians of all walks of the musical journey.</p>
			<p>	This company was established by Edward J. Davenport of the locally famed musical Kenneth Davenport
				family in the mid seventies. The entire Davenport family was committed to music led by Ken's tenure in
				the Minneapolis Symphony and wife, Janet's piano involvement in the city music functions. Ed and his sisters
				played strings professionally most of their lives and were key players in establishing string programs in the
				high schools of the northern suburbs of Minneapolis in the sixties and seventies.</p>
			<p>	Davenport Repair has always employed musicians turned techs in order to keep the love and involvement in
				music alive within the repair confines. That remains true today. We want to understand the language of the
				musician as well as know the mechanics of the instruments we specialize in.</p>
			<p>	We currently boast of our 142 years of combined experience within our staff of ten technicians in order
				to reassure our customers that each repair is done by the tech specializing in the particular procedure. We
				pride ourselves in swapping knowledge and techniques between us utilizing the wealth of experience our company
				has to draw from.</p>
			<p>	Davenport Repair Company was sold to Ed's manager and woodwind tech of 25 years, Doug Kuehn, in July of 2005.
				Having seen the operating styles, service habits, and business practices of Ed Davenport for 25 years, Doug has
				vowed to continue the legacy and the three key operations (great work, great prices, and quick delivery) that have
				make this company so strong and successful.</p>
			<p>	We welcome you to visit us. We are conveniently located within 3 Schmitt Music locations in the metro and
				transfer instruments between all Schmitt locations 3 times a week making us closer that you realize!</p>
